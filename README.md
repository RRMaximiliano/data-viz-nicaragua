# Data Visualizations: Nicaragua

This repository contains data and code about different aspects of the social and economic state of Nicaragua. Please feel free to share with your friends and colleagues.

In this repository you will find topic-related folders as follows: 

* Topic I:
  * data
  * figs
  * script

I have used `R` for most of the codes. There should be no issue if you want to replicate these figures.

Currently, this repository contains data on:

## Air pollution
